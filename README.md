# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description
This project predicts car prices using Machine Learning based on:
- Brand
- Mileage
- Horsepower
- Engine Size
- Car Age

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

## Steps Performed
1. Dataset creation (automatic CSV generation)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation
7. Price prediction

## Output
The model predicts car prices and visualizes actual vs predicted values.

## Internship
This project is completed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship Program.
